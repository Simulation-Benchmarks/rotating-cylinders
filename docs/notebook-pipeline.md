# Notebook pipeline

The `notebooks/rotating_cylinders.ipynb` notebook in this repository is
**auto-generated** on every push to `main` (and on manual
`workflow_dispatch`).

## Inputs

- Documentation: `docs/rotating-cylinders.md`
- Postprocessing script: `dumux/convergence_test.py` (source of truth for
  the code cells)
- Output: `notebooks/rotating_cylinders.ipynb`

## How it works

The workflow at `.github/workflows/merge-docs-to-notebooks.yml` runs
`scripts/build_notebook.py`, which:

1. Reads the documentation markdown.
2. Parses the postprocessing script with `ast.parse` and embeds each
   top-level definition as a code cell. The `if __name__ == "__main__":`
   guard is stripped so the cell runs end-to-end when the notebook is
   opened.
3. Prepends the documentation as a markdown cell (with a Binder badge).
4. Writes the result as a Jupyter notebook to the output path.

The result is committed back to `main` with `[skip ci]`.
